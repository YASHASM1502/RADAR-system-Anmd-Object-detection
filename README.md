Radar, derived from the term Radio Detection and Ranging, represents a groundbreaking digital technology designed to hit upon items at a distance by using making use of radio waves.
This transformative device measures the time taken for radio waves to bounce off gadgets, presenting important information together with an object’s role, speed, and different traits. The effect of radar generation spans across numerous domains, revolutionizing navigation and surveillance applications in fields ranging from meteorology to army operations

A radar machine is a sophisticated mixture of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter generates and emits radio waves, even as the receiver detects echoes produced while those waves 
come upon gadgets. By studying the time postpone among wave transmission and echo reception, a radar machine can determine the variety, attitude, and speed of gadgets, making it an essential device for tracking and identifying numerous objectives.

OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATIONS
Applications of Radar
The versatility of radar era is clear in its huge variety of applications:
Air Traffic Control: Monitoring and guiding aircraft.
Weather Forecasting: Tracking storms, precipitation, and atmospheric situations.
Military Surveillance: Detecting and tracking enemy objectives for countrywide safety.
Maritime Navigation: Assisting ships in navigation and collision avoidance.

COMPONENTS USED IN THE PROTOTYPE![ping-sensor-radar-730x423](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6e58c4c-539f-42e9-b241-4603fc0116f6)

❖ NodeMCU (ESP8266) Microcontroller: o Acts as the central control unit for the system, managing inputs and outputs, and connecting to the mobile Wi-Fi network. 
❖ Arduino Uno: o Works in conjunction with the NodeMCU to control additional components such as the ultrasonic sensor and servo motors.
